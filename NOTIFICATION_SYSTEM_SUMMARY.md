# ðŸŽ‰ WhatsApp Notification System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

## âœ… **PROBLEM SOLVED: Dual Notifications Implemented**

### **Your Question**: 
> "When we create a task, how does the user get notified? I want notifications. One notification should go to the user that task has been assigned to him, and one notification should go to the creator that you have assigned this task to this user."

### **âœ… SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
**Dual WhatsApp notifications are now working!**

## ðŸ”” **How Notifications Work Now**

### **When a Task is Created:**

#### **1. Notification to Assigned User** ðŸ“±
```
ðŸ”” New Task Assigned!

ðŸ“‹ Task: [Task Title]
ðŸ“„ Description: [Description]
ðŸ“… Due Date: [Date]
âš¡ Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
ðŸ‘¤ Assigned by: [Creator Name]

Reply with:
â€¢ START - Begin working
â€¢ COMPLETE - Mark as done
â€¢ NEED HELP - Request assistance
â€¢ STATUS - Check current status
```

#### **2. Confirmation to Creator** âœ…
```
âœ… Task Created Successfully!

ðŸ“‹ Task: [Task Title]
ðŸ‘¤ Assigned to: [Assigned User Name]
ðŸ“± WhatsApp: [Assigned User's WhatsApp]
ðŸ“… Due Date: [Date]
âš¡ Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

The assigned user has been notified via WhatsApp.
```
