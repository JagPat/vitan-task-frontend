## 🧠 **Smart Features**

### **🎯 Task Number Recognition**
The system now understands:
- `"start task 1"` ✅
- `"begin 2"` ✅  
- `"done with #3"` ✅
- `"finish task number 4"` ✅
- `"hold 5"` ✅

### **🔄 Status Word Recognition**
**To Start Tasks:** start, begin, working, progress, active
**To Complete:** done, complete, finish, ready, closed
**To Pause:** hold, pause, wait, defer
**To Cancel:** cancel, drop, abort, stop

### **💡 Smart Error Handling**
If you type `"start task"` without a number:
```
📋 Please mention the task number. Try saying:
• "start task 1"
• "mark 2 done"  
• "finish task 3"
• "hold 4"

Type "my tasks" to see your task list with numbers.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **❌ Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"Sorry, there was an error. Please try again."**
**Causes:**
1. **Task number doesn't exist** → Type `/tasks` to see valid numbers
2. **Not registered** → Type `/register [your name] [email]`
3. **Task not assigned to you** → Ask team lead to assign it

**Solutions:**
```
Step 1: /tasks                     (Get your task list)
Step 2: "start task [number]"      (Use exact number from list)
```

#### **"Find task, assigned to me" Not Working**
**Wrong:** `"Find task, assigned to me"`
**Right:** `/tasks` or `"show my tasks"`

#### **"start task" Without Number**
**Wrong:** `"start task"`
**Right:** `"start task 1"` (include the task number)

### **🔄 Step-by-Step Task Update**
```
1. Get your tasks:     "my tasks"
2. Note the number:    (e.g., "1. Fix login bug")  
3. Update status:      "start task 1"
4. Confirm:           ✅ Task "Fix login bug" marked as In Progress!
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **✅ Do:**
- Use `menu` for easy button interface
- Include task numbers: `"start task 1"`
- Use natural language: `"show my tasks"`
- Be specific: `"done with task 3"`

### **❌ Don't:**
- Use vague commands: `"Find task, assigned to me"`
- Forget task numbers: `"start task"` (needs number)
- Use complex phrases: `"Find task, assigned to me"`
