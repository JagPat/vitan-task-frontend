## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **❌ The Problem:**
The **real WhatsApp contact sharing** is not triggering the AI-enhanced processing. This suggests:

1. **Webhook not receiving contact messages** - Real WhatsApp contact sharing isn't reaching our server
2. **Old code still running** - Deployment or caching issue
3. **WhatsApp Business API configuration** - Contact messages not properly configured

### **✅ The Solution:**
Enhanced debugging and webhook logging to identify the exact issue.
