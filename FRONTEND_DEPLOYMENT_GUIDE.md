# üöÄ Frontend Deployment Guide - Railway

## üìã Overview

This guide will help you deploy the WhatsTask frontend to Railway, creating a unified platform with both frontend and backend on the same service.

## üéØ Current Status

- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Deployed at `https://vitan-task-production.up.railway.app`
- **Frontend**: üîÑ Ready for Railway deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Railway managed)

## üì¶ Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure your frontend code is in the repository
3. **Railway CLI** (Optional): `npm install -g @railway/cli`

## üîß Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

1. **Login to Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your frontend repository: `JagPat/vitan-task-frontend`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, add these environment variables:

```env
# Required Environment Variables
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://vitan-task-production.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**How to add:**
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on "Variables" tab
3. Add each variable:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = `https://vitan-task-production.up.railway.app`
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `PORT` = `3000` (Railway will override this automatically)

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings

Railway will automatically detect your Vite project, but you can customize the build settings:

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: `npx serve dist -p $PORT`
3. **Install Command**: `npm ci`

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Railway will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch
   - Monitor the deployment in the Railway dashboard

2. **Manual Deployment** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Link your project
   railway link
   
   # Deploy
   railway up
   ```

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Go to your Railway project dashboard
- Check the "Deployments" tab
- Ensure the deployment is successful (green status)

### 2. Test the Application
- Visit your Railway frontend URL
- Test the following functionality:
  - ‚úÖ Dashboard loads
  - ‚úÖ API calls to backend
  - ‚úÖ Task creation
  - ‚úÖ User management
  - ‚úÖ Analytics

### 3. Check Environment Variables
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, verify:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://vitan-task-production.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Test API Connectivity
Open browser console and check for:
- ‚úÖ API calls to backend
- ‚ùå CORS errors
- ‚ùå 404 errors on API endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Files

### railway.json (Already configured)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx serve dist -p $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### nixpacks.toml (Already configured)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs_22', 'npm-9_x']

[phases.install]
cmds = ['npm ci']

[phases.build]
cmds = ['npm run build', 'npm prune --production']

[start]
cmd = 'npm start'
```

### package.json (Already configured)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "start": "npx serve dist -p $PORT"
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Build Failures
**Symptoms**: Build fails in Railway
**Solutions**:
1. Check `package.json` for correct scripts
2. Verify all dependencies are in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`)
3. Check for TypeScript errors

#### Issue 2: API Connection Errors
**Symptoms**: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly
2. Check backend is running at the specified URL
3. Test API endpoints manually

#### Issue 3: Port Issues
**Symptoms**: Application won't start
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set
2. Check `npx serve dist -p $PORT` command
3. Verify Railway port configuration

#### Issue 4: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Symptoms**: App can't find environment variables
**Solutions**:
1. Restart the deployment after adding variables
2. Check variable names (must start with `VITE_` for Vite)
3. Verify no typos in variable names

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Restart deployment
railway up

# Check build logs
railway logs --build
```
