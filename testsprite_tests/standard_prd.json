  "product_overview": "WhatsTask is a comprehensive WhatsApp-first task and vendor management system designed to enable non-technical users, especially vendors and field agents, to manage tasks naturally via WhatsApp. It seamlessly integrates AI-driven natural language understanding, multi-language support, task and project management, team collaboration, and an admin dashboard with cost control, all accessible through both a modern React frontend and WhatsApp messaging interface.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable natural language task and vendor management via WhatsApp without needing structured commands.",
    "Support multiple languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Hinglish for wide adoption.",
    "Provide an intelligent AI interaction system with adaptive learning and contextual guidance.",
    "Deliver seamless team and project management with role-based access control.",
    "Implement robust backend API integration with real-time task notifications through WhatsApp.",
    "Include a comprehensive admin dashboard with AI cost management and system health monitoring.",
    "Ensure reliable and scalable deployment using modern cloud infrastructure (Railway)."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Natural Language Processing supporting multiple languages with intent recognition and entity extraction.",
    "Adaptive AI learning interface for unstructured user inputs with real-time clarification and pattern management.",
    "Comprehensive task and project management with CRUD operations, status tracking, priority handling, and assignment capabilities.",
    "Team and user management with role-based access and detailed analytics.",
    "WhatsApp integration for contact registration, task notifications, interactive menus, and status updates.",
    "Dual WhatsApp notifications system sending alerts to both task assignees and creators.",
    "Intelligent phone number extraction and handling for contact sharing, supporting multiple phone number formats and user choice.",
    "Robust authentication system with phone number normalization and verification via WhatsApp.",
    "Frontend built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI, featuring responsive design and rich analytics charts.",
    "Backend API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, featuring webhook handling and AI service integration.",
    "Cost management system with usage tracking, budget controls, emergency stop, and optimization techniques.",
    "Comprehensive error handling and user experience enhancements to prevent loops and provide meaningful feedback."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User sends a natural language message or WhatsApp contact to the system.",
    "The AI processing pipeline detects language, extracts intent and entities, and validates the input.",
    "For contact sharing, the system extracts multiple phone numbers and prompts the user if multiple numbers are found.",
    "The system registers the user or vendor, sends confirmation messages, and logs activities.",
    "For task management commands, the system processes the user request, sends dual WhatsApp notifications to assigned user and creator, and updates status accordingly.",
    "Admins use the React frontend to create tasks, manage projects and teams, and monitor analytics and AI usage.",
    "Users interact via WhatsApp sending natural language commands or selecting from interactive menus.",
    "The AI interface provides contextual guidance, intelligent clarification, and adapts patterns over time with admin review capabilities.",
    "The admin supervises the AI learning system through a dashboard with cost management and system health monitoring.",
    "All interactions are logged and validated to ensure data consistency and security."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "System correctly processes natural language commands in English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Hinglish with expected intent recognition accuracy greater than 90%.",
    "Multiple phone numbers in contact sharing are detected and user selection is prompted accurately with no data loss.",
    "Dual WhatsApp notifications are sent reliably to both task assignees and creators upon task creation and status updates, with confirmation of delivery.",
    "Frontend and backend maintain consistent phone number normalization formats (with and without +) for UI and API respectively.",
    "Authentication system allows login and verification workflows without errors, including WhatsApp verification code confirmation.",
    "Admin dashboard provides real-time AI usage metrics, system health status, and cost management controls with live updates.",
    "The AI learning system tracks unknown inputs, learns patterns correctly, and supports admin manual override and pattern management.",
    "Frontend UI navigations work directly via URLs with SPA routing fixed and no 404 errors on refresh or direct access.",
    "All backend API endpoints return expected responses with error handling for invalid requests and maintain data consistency.",
    "The system gracefully handles clarifications without looping, provides helpful user guidance, and prevents repeated errors.",
    "Automated and manual tests cover all critical user workflows with at least 80% pass rate before production deployment."
