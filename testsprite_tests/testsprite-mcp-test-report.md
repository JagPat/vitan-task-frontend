- **Task creation completely blocked** (core functionality)
- **Multiple UI stability issues** (React key warnings)
- **Poor accessibility compliance**

**Overall Status:** ❌ **Not Production Ready**

**Priority:** Fix critical authentication and task creation issues before any further development or deployment.
