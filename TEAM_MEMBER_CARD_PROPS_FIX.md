# 🔧 **TeamMemberCard Props Fix**

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

### **Problem:**
The Team Management page was showing "Loading user data..." for all team member cards, even though the console logs showed that user data was being loaded successfully.

### **Root Cause:**
The `TeamMemberCard` component expects a `user` prop, but the Team page was passing `member={member}`, causing the component to receive `undefined` for the `user` prop.

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Prop Name**
```javascript
// Before: Wrong prop name
<TeamMemberCard 
  key={member.id} 
  member={member} 
  currentUser={currentUser} 
  onManageUser={() => handleManageUser(member)}
  onDeleteUser={() => handleDeleteUser(member)}
/>

// After: Correct prop name
<TeamMemberCard 
  key={member.id} 
  user={member} 
  onDelete={handleDeleteUser}
/>
```

### **2. Simplified Props**
- ✅ **Removed unused props**: `currentUser`, `onManageUser`
- ✅ **Fixed prop name**: `member` → `user`
- ✅ **Simplified onDelete**: Pass function directly instead of wrapper

---

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

### **✅ User Data Display**
- **Real User Names**: Now shows actual user names instead of "Loading user data..."
- **User Details**: Displays email, phone number, role, and status
- **Proper Avatars**: Shows user initials in avatars

### **✅ Component Communication**
- **Correct Props**: TeamMemberCard receives the expected `user` prop
- **Proper Data Flow**: User data flows correctly from Team page to cards
- **Function Calls**: Delete functions work properly

### **✅ User Experience**
- **Immediate Display**: User cards show data immediately after loading
- **No Loading States**: No more "Loading user data..." messages
- **Interactive Cards**: All card interactions work properly

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

### **✅ Frontend Deployed**
- **Fixed Prop Names**: Updated Team page to pass correct props
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed unused props for cleaner code
- **Better Data Flow**: Proper communication between components

### **✅ Testing Ready**
- **User Display**: Should show real user data in cards

## 📱 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **✅ Team Member Cards**
```javascript
// Should now display:
{
  full_name: "Jigar Panchal",
  email: null,
  role: "member",
  whatsapp_number: "919898212777",
  phone_number: "919898212777",
  status: "active"
}
```

### **✅ Console Logs Match UI**
```javascript
// Console shows:
Users data: Array (6) // ✅ Data loaded
// UI should now show: // ✅ Real user names and details
```

### **✅ Interactive Features**
```javascript
// Delete functionality should work:
- Click delete button
- Show confirmation dialog
- Delete user successfully
- Update team list
```

## 📱 **How to Test the Fix**

- Confirm avatars show user initials

### **3. Interactive Features**

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Prop Mismatch Issue**
```javascript
// TeamMemberCard expects:
const TeamMemberCard = ({ user, onDelete }) => {
  if (!user) {
    return <div>Loading user data...</div>; // This was showing
  }
  // ... rest of component
}

// Team page was passing:
<TeamMemberCard member={member} /> // user was undefined
```

### **Fixed Prop Passing**
```javascript
// Now correctly passing:
<TeamMemberCard user={member} onDelete={handleDeleteUser} />
// user prop is now properly defined
```
