# 🎯 Interactive Guidance System - Enhanced User Experience

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: The AI was creating tasks and vendors with default/empty values instead of guiding users to provide complete information.

**Examples of Poor UX**:
```
User: "Create task"
AI: ✅ Task created successfully!
📋 Task: Untitled Task
📝 Description: No description
⏰ Due: No due date
🎯 Priority: medium
```

**Root Cause**: The system was using fallback values (`'Untitled Task'`, `'No description'`, etc.) instead of guiding users to provide meaningful information.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **🎯 Interactive Task Creation**

#### **Before (Poor UX)**:
```
User: "Create task"
AI: Creates task with defaults
Result: Untitled Task with no useful information
```

#### **After (Guided UX)**:
```
User: "Create task"
AI: 📋 Let's create a task together!

Please provide the task details:

📝 **Task Title** (required): What do you want to call this task?
📄 **Description** (optional): Any additional details?
⏰ **Due Date** (optional): When should this be completed?
🎯 **Priority** (optional): high, medium, or low?

💡 **Examples**:
• "Create task: Review documents by tomorrow"
• "New task: Call client - high priority"
• "Task: Prepare presentation for Friday meeting"
```

### **🎯 Interactive Vendor Registration**

#### **Self-Registration (register_vendor)**:
```
User: "I want to register as vendor"
AI: 👤 Let's register you as a vendor!

Please provide your details:

📝 **Your Name** (required): What's your name?
📧 **Email** (optional): Your email address?
📍 **Address** (optional): Your location?

💡 **Examples**:
• "Register me as John Smith"
• "I'm a vendor: Sarah Johnson - sarah@email.com"
• "Vendor registration: Mike Wilson from Mumbai"
```

#### **Adding Someone Else (add_vendor)**:
```
User: "Add vendor"
AI: 👤 Let's add a new vendor to the system!

Please provide the vendor details:

📝 **Vendor Name** (required): What's the vendor's name?
📱 **Phone Number** (required): What's their phone number?
📧 **Email** (optional): Their email address?
📍 **Address** (optional): Their location?

💡 **Examples**:
• "Add vendor John Smith with phone 1234567890"
• "New vendor: ABC Company - 9876543210"
• "Add vendor Sarah Johnson - sarah@email.com - 5551234567"
